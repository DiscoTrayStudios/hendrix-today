# hendrix-today-app 

A project which will turn the Hendrix Today daily emails into an app which provides a more user-friendly experience for students.

Hendrix Communications sends out daily emails about campus events, meetings, announcements, and most importantly the lunch menu for the day. Our team wanted to revamp this communication system and make it more accessible and visually appealling. Our app has many cool new features that have never been seen before such as an interactive calendar, a search bar, and filters for the different event types. We made sure to make the orange in teh app a web orange so that it is more accessible to more users. Since this app will be used daily by the hendrix student we made sure to get a lot of input. We polled many of our peers and asked what they wanted to see in this app and what they wanted was a simplist design that wasn't too overwhelming. As seen below we made just that.
